# FUTURE_DS_01

This repository contains the work and codebase for my future internship project. It is designed as a data science focused project, which aims to demonstrate my skills and knowledge in the field of data science and machine learning.

## About This Project

This repository is a culmination of my learnings, experiments, and implementations during my internship preparation and future data science projects. It includes scripts, notebooks, datasets, and results related to various data science tasks.

## Features

- Data collection and preprocessing scripts
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebooks
- Model building and evaluation
- Visualization of results
- Documented experiments and findings

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)
- Recommended: Create and activate a virtual environment

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
